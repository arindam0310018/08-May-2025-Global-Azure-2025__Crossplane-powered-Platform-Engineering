| Defination in Simple English:- |
| --------- |

Crossplane is a CNCF project that helps you manage cloud resources in a Kubernetes-native way. 
With Kubernetes, we used to manage only application, but with Crossplane, we can now manage cloud infrastructure.
For Ease of understanding, consider like this -
- With Crossplane, we can write a Kubernetes YAML file, and it will create the desired Cloud Resources (For Example - A Resource Group), directly from Kubernetes cluster.
